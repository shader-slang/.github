The Slang shading language and compiler empowers real-time graphics developers with advanced language features to enhance portability
and productivity in GPU shader development. Slang supports modular development of large shader codebases and enables shader deployment
across diverse target platforms.

Slang is fully open-source and all developments for Slang take place within the public GitHub repo. Since November 2024 Slang has been
under open-governance at The Khronos Group to encourage and enable broad industry collaboration to propel its continued growth and
evolution.
